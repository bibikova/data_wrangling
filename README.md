# data_wrangling
study project 

The dataset which is being wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

Goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive  only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for analyses and visualizations.

 Additional data was gathered from Twitter's API and image prediction file.
